    <h3>Pig and PigLatin</h3>
    
    <h4>About</h4>
    <p>Pig was initially developed at Yahoo! to allow people using Apache Hadoop&#174; to focus more on analyzing large data sets and spend less time having to write<br/> mapper and reducer programs. Like actual pigs, who eat almost anything, the Pig programming language is designed to handle any kind of data--hence the <br/>name!.</p>
    <p>Pig is made up of two components: the first is the language itself, which is called PigLatin (yes, peope naming various Hadoop projects do tend to have a <br/>sense of humor associated with their naming conventions), and the second is a runtime environment where PigLatin programs are executed. Think of the <br/>relationship between a Java Virtual Machine (JVM) and a Java application. In this section, we'll just refer to the whole entity as Pig.</p>
